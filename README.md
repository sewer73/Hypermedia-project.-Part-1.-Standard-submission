## Target User Profile
    The final user of this website is a potential employer, colleague, or anyone interested in learning about Jane Smith as a computer engineer. 
    They are likely looking for information about her skills, experience, and qualifications, as well as contact details. 
    The website aims to present Jane Smith's professional profile effectively and showcase her work.

## Organization
    I organized the content into several sections for easy navigation: About Me, Experience, Education, Skills, and Contact.
    The header contains a background image of a desktop, Jane Smith's photo, name, and job title.
    I organized navigation links at the top and are easily accessible for quick section navigation.
    Also, I used images of each topic to provide more context and dynamism.
    The contact section provides Jane Smith's email address and phone number, making it easy for visitors to get in touch.
    
## Design
    Background color is dark gray for a modern and professional look, text color is white for better contrast, and finally blue is for contact information.
    I used the main font Roboto for readability and a clean look. Also I styled header fonts are styled with larger font size and dark background for emphasis.
    In some text I used 'Courier New' or 'monospace' for code-like content.
    I was inspired by a modern and professional simple style and easy navigation.
